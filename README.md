## There is now a "Endgame" strict filter you can see by the file name, differences are listed below

Changes Made
- Fixed T1 Unique Drop Sound to be a Tink.
- Filtered more uniques from the filter.
- Added a new Tier, T2 Uniques. This is for Multibase Uniques that are 1d or 20ex+.
- Moved Heavy Belt to T1 Unique (2 unique drop from this but one is cheap boss drop from Trial Master, Headhunter is global).
- Renamed "Decent Uniques" to "T3 Uniques" this is for items roughly 5-20ex that should sell quite well.
