## There is now a "Endgame" strict filter you can see by the file name, differences are listed below

Endgame Filter
- Stricter rare filtering (specific expert bases only showing).
- Removed Rare Belts from rare filtering
- Regals are now hidden
- Removed the remaining catalyst that are showing on the filter ("Neural Catalyst" "Adaptive Catalyst" "Tul's Catalyst") just copy paste the items in bracket if you want to add them back
- Tier 14 and below are hidden (This can be changed just by following instruction in the google doc).
- Enchanted maps are now showing (This applies to Tier 13 and above).
- Removed Heavy Belt as a chance item (HH is about 13d or less now; doesn't seem worth the chance for how rare it is)

- Moved Stellar Amulet from chance to its own section for alcing (this whill be black background, white text/border)
